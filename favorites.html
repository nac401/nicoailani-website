                <h1>a few of my favorite things</h1>
                <p>I firmly believe that I am made up of the things that I love. Here are a few of the works and people that have really inspired me.</p>
                <div class="separator"></div>
                <!--list of games-->
                <h2>games</h2>
                <p>If you want a more comprehensive breakdown of the many games that I have played, you can check out my <a href="https://ggapp.io/thewriterwins">GG</a>. These games are in no particular order, but they are all games I think are very special.</p>
                <li><strong>God of War.</strong> Specifically, the two most recent entries. Brilliant, deliberate narratives that are as personal and intimate as they are mythic and huge.</li>
                <li><strong>Outer Wilds.</strong> Perhaps the most captivating and emotional experience I have had in a video game. I beg that you play it.</li>
                <li><strong>Disco Elysium.</strong> Sharp writing in an intricate world with commentary bleeding through the cobblestone. One of my favorite narrative experiences in games.</li>
                <li><strong>Inscryption.</strong> The marriage of my two favorite things: a twisted meta-narrative and brilliant system design.</li>
                <li><strong>Return of the Obra Dinn.</strong> When I think of the perfect intersection of puzzle and cinema, I think of Obra Dinn.</li>
                <li><strong>Dev. Bennet Foddy.</strong> <i>Getting Over It</i> and <i>Baby Steps</i> are both extremely influential games to my design proclivities and both touch on a very particular corner of my sense of humor that no other art really has.</li>
                
                <!--list of movies-->
                <h2>movies</h2>
                <p>Of course, you could also check out my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/nicoailani/">Letterboxd</a>. These people and individual movies have either been integral to forming my taste and style or recent hits that have really blown me away.</p>
                <li><strong>Dir. Thomas Vinterberg.</strong> <i>The Celebration</i>, <i>The Hunt</i>, and <i>Another Round</i> all make it into my monumental-movies-about-humans category of favorites.</li>
                <li><strong>Dir. Shane Black.</strong> <i>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</i> and <i>The Nice Guys</i> were both formative movies to my style as a writer. I thought: that's how I want to write.</li>
                <li><strong>Dir. Bong Joon Ho.</strong> <i>Memories of Murder</i> and <i>Parasite</i> are both immense movies. And Bong Joon Ho embodies the kind of thematic consistency that I'd love to have.</li>
                <li><strong>Weapons.</strong> If I were to pick one movie to be the blueprint for pacing, excellent tonal variety, and parallel perspective done right— it's <i>Weapons</i> all the way down, baby.</li>
                <li><strong>Crazy, Stupid, Love.</strong> No movie has hit the 3rd Act Reversal high of <i>Crazy, Stupid, Love</i>. Perhaps no movie ever will.</li>
                <li><strong>RRR</strong> When they talk about movies being larger than life, this is the largest. Simply monumental in every way.</li>
                
                <!--list of tv shows-->
                <h2>television</h2>
                <p>I feel as if I haven't watched some of the TV greats, like <i>Sopranos</i> and <i>Twin Peaks</i>. There's still time. Until then, you'll have to deal with this paltry list of absolute excellence.</p>
                <li><strong>Wtr. Damon Lindelof.</strong> While <i>Lost</i> is iconic. It was <i>The Leftovers</i> that solidified Damon as one of my favorite writers. Then <i>Watchmen</i> just doubled that bet.</li>
                <li><strong>The Rehearsal.</strong> I'm confident in calling <i>The Rehearsal</i> the biggest rollercoaster ride of the century, and we're only a couple of decades in.</li>
                <li><strong>I Think You Should Leave.</strong> No sketch comedy show has made me feel the way <i>I Think You Should Leave</i> makes me feel. I quote it constantly, I love it dearly.</li>
                <li><strong>Severance.</strong> The kind of mystery show I just can't get enough of. I love a show that builds a community through the weekly discussions between episodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Taskmaster.</strong> No show brings me as much concentrated joy as <i>Taskmaster</i>. Not only is it a fantastic comedy show, it is also a compelling study of non-traditional game design principles.</li>

                <!--list of comics-->
                <h2>comics</h2>
                <p>I've been a huge DC comics person for most of my life, so forgive my biases. I've recently been branching out into a lot of creator-owned comics and smaller publishers, and I will update this page when those begin to sweep me off my feet.</p>
                <li><strong>Wtr. Grant Morrison.</strong> From <i>Animal Man</i> to their iconic run with <i>Batman</i>, Grant will always be a favorite of mine in all of their weird and wild glory.</li>
                <li><strong>Wtr. Scott Snyder.</strong> His New 52 run with <i>Batman</i> is one of my favorite runs of all time, and I'm currently enjoying <i>Absolute Batman</i>. He's one of those writers who just tickles my brain with how cool the subject matter is.</li>
                <li><strong>Wtr. Deniz Camp.</strong> A recent favorite because of <i>Assorted Crisis Events</i> and <i>Absolute Martian Manhunter</i>. If I could be in the mind of any one comic book writer for a day, it would be Deniz Camp. I have got to start reading <i>The Ultimates</i> as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Art. Francesco Francavilla.</strong> When I read <i>Batman: Black Mirror</i> I was blown away by the art and instantly became a fan of Francavilla. One of the few modern artists whose work I find instantly recognizable.</li>
                <li><strong>Art. Hayden Sherman.</strong> Another artist whose work I felt immediately magnetized towards. <i>Absolute Wonder Woman</i> and <i>Dark Patterns</i> both are absolutely gorgeous.</li>

                <!--list of books-->
                <h2>books</h2>
                <p>Thank God for a long commute, it gives me an excuse to read more often.</p>
                <li><strong>Left Hand of Darkness.</strong> It has everything: subterfuge, interplanetary politics, a long hike riddled with sexual tension. This book is the benchmark for good sci-fi for me.</li>
                <li><strong>Sharks in the Time of Saviors.</strong> Though the author is not Native Hawaiian, this book absolutely captures the experience of living as a Hawaiian today. It is also a brilliantly written book.</li>
                <li><strong>A. Tana French.</strong> Tana French's <i>Dublin Murder Squad</i> series was life-changing. Every book is unique, with such brilliant character development it took my breath away. Though they are all excellent, <i>The Likeness</i> and <i>Faithful Place</i> are probably my favorites.</li>
                <li><strong>A. N.K. Jemisin.</strong> This might be a bit of a cheat because I love Jemisin as a comic book writer and author. <i>The City We Became</i>, <i>Broken Earth</i>, <i>Far Sector</i>, and the host of her talks that I've listened to have made me a humongous fan.</li>
