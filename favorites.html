                <h1>a few of my favorite things</h1>
                <p>I firmly believe that I am made up of the things that I love. Here are a few of the works and people that have really inspired me.</p>

                <!--list of games-->
                <h2>games</h2>
                <p>If you want a more comprehensive breakdown of the many games that I have played, you can check out my <a href="https://ggapp.io/thewriterwins">GG</a>. These games are in no particular order but they are all games I think are very special.</p>
                <li><strong>God of War.</strong> Specifically, the two most recent entries. Brilliant, deliberate narratives that are as personal and intimate as they are mythic and huge.</li>
                <li><strong>Outer Wilds.</strong> Perhaps the most captivating and emotional experience I have had in a video game. I beg that you play it.</li>
                <li><strong>Disco Elysium.</strong> Sharp writing in an intricate world with commentary bleeding through the cobblestone. One of my favorite narrative experiences in games.</li>
                <li><strong>Inscryption.</strong> The marriage of my two favorite things: a twisted meta narrative and brilliant system design.</li>
                <li><strong>Return of the Obra Dinn.</strong> When I think of the perfect intersection of puzzle and cinema, I think of Obra Dinn.</li>            
                
                <!--list of movies-->
                <h2>movies</h2>
                <p>Of course, you could also check out my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/nicoailani/">Letterboxd</a>. These people and individual movies have either been integral to forming my taste and style or recent hits that have really blown me away.</p>
                <li><strong>Dir. Thomas Vinterberg.</strong> <i>The Celebration</i>, <i>The Hunt</i>, and <i>Another Round</i> all make it into my monumental-movies-about-humans category of favorites.</li>
                <li><strong>Dir. Shane Black.</strong> <i>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</i> and <i>The Nice Guys</i> both were formative movies to my style as a writer. I thought: that's how I want to write.</li>
                <li><strong>Dir. Bong Joon Ho.</strong> <i>Memories of Murder</i> and <i>Parasite</i> are both immense movies. And Bong Joon Ho embodies the kind of thematic consistency that I'd love to have.</li>
                <li><strong>Weapons.</strong> If I were to pick one movie to be the blueprint for pacing, excellent tonal variety, and parallel perspective done rightâ€” it's <i>Weapons</i> all the way down, baby.</li>
                <li><strong>Crazy, Stupid, Love.</strong> No movie has hit the 3rd Act Reversal high of <i>Crazy, Stupid, Love</i>. Perhaps no movie ever will.</li>

                <p>Intro text.</p>
                <li><strong>Wtr. Damon Lindelof.</strong> While <i>Lost</i> is iconic. It was <i>The Leftovers</i> that solidified Damon as one of my favorite writers. Then <i>Watchmen</i> just doubled that bet.</li>
                <li><strong>The Rehearsal.</strong> I'm confident in calling <i>The Rehearsal</i> the biggest rollercoaster ride of the century and we're only a couple of decades in.</li>
                <li><strong>I Think You Should Leave.</strong> No sketch comedy show has made me feel the way <i>I Think You Should Leave</i> makes me feel. I quote it constantly, I love it dearly.</li>
                <li><strong>Show.</strong> Text on show.</li>
