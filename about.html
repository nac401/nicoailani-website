                <h1>about me</h1>
                <p>My name is Nico, and I am a writer, game designer, and narrative designer. I've worked as a bartender, electrician, barista, administrator, and teacher, and I believe that the winding road that has led me to the work that I do today has made me a better person (and definitely a better writer). </p>

                <h1>about this website</h1>
                <p>I created this website to showcase my <a href="/work.html">work</a> in case you might want to hire me, collaborate with me, or otherwise be my friend. This website was created by me, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No "AI" or LLM was used in the creation of this website, but many YouTube videos were watched and many forums were read.</p> 
                <p>My work— like this website —is created by me, often with the help of other human beings.</p>
