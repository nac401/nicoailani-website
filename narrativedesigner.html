            <h2>narrative designer</h2>
            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p>My work as a narrative designer is influenced by 5+ years of screenwriting experience, ~10 years of experience as a Game Master of various tabletop role-playing games, and most recently, roughly 3 years of creating narrative video games.</p>
            <div class="separator"></div>

            <h3>narrative systems</h3>
            <p>I have experience designing, engineering, and implementing narrative systems using <strong>Lua</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> and using <strong>spreadsheets</strong> as a tool to simplify writing for complex and branching narratives.</p>
